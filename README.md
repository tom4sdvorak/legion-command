# Legion Command v0.8.0

Legion Command is a single-lane 2D strategy game with progression system. Carefully choose your three units, counter opponent with strategic formation, pick the right upgrades while managing your money, and crush the enemy base to unlock permanent upgrades that enhance your future game.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
- Single-Lane Combat: The action is focused on one lane. Positioning, unit synergy, and timely deployment are crucial to gaining ground against the enemy base.
- Three-Unit Roster: Before each battle, you choose only 3 units from your entire collection. The AI's selection varies by level, so counter-picking is more than waranted.
- The Economy: While AI accumulates most money passively, you are rewarded more heavily for kills. Making smart, aggressive deployment can create powerful momentum, but play too carefuly and the AI might overwhelm you.
- In-Battle Upgrades: As you level up you get to choose from random battle upgrades for the units, unlocking potent stat boosts or even game changing abilities for the ongoing match.
- Global Upgrades: Win or lose, the better you did the more you get rewarded. Invest this currency into permament upgrades for your base or units, making you stronger for every upcoming battle.
